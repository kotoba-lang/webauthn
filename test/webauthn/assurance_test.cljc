  "The rule that decides whether an authenticator may approve a payment.

  The decision was a Secure Enclave key requiring Touch ID, so that an agent
  cannot approve on the owner's behalf. The property under test is therefore not
  'does a platform credential pass' -- it is **does a credential that merely SAYS
  platform fail to reach the level that a signed AAGUID reaches**. If those two
  graded the same, the whole distinction would be decorative and a browser's
  virtual authenticator would clear the same bar as the Secure Enclave."
