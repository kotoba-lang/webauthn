  "WebAuthn Level 2 ceremony verification for the edge — the real
  registration/assertion crypto, on WebCrypto only (`crypto.subtle`), with no
  npm dependency and no platform binding.

  ## What this is, and what it deliberately is not

  It is a pure function of its inputs plus WebCrypto: give it the byte blobs a
  browser's `navigator.credentials` produced and the facts you already know
  (the challenge you issued, your RP id and origin, and — for a login — the
  public key you stored at registration), and it tells you whether that
  ceremony really happened.

  It does NOT touch storage, key custody, sessions or CACAO. That separation is
  the point: the prior art this is ported from
  (`cloud-itonami.edge.webauthn`, in production since 2026-07) fused ceremony
  verification, KV schema, an AES-GCM key-wrapping scheme and CACAO minting
  into one namespace, which made all four untestable without Cloudflare
  bindings and unreusable by the second consumer. Here the caller owns
  challenge storage (it must be single-use — see below), credential storage,
  and whatever it decides to do with a verified ceremony.

  ## The checks, and why each one is not optional

  Registration (`verify-registration!`):
    - `clientData.type` is `webauthn.create`, `origin` matches exactly, and
      `challenge` equals the one the caller issued.
    - `authData` carries attested credential data and the user-present flag.
    - `authData`'s `rpIdHash` equals SHA-256(rp-id) — otherwise a credential
      created for another RP could be presented here.
    - the credential public key is COSE EC2 / P-256, returned as a raw
      65-byte uncompressed point for the caller to store.

  Authentication (`verify-authentication!`):
    - the same clientData checks, with type `webauthn.get`.
    - `authData` is PARSED and its user-present flag and `rpIdHash` checked.
      Verifying only the signature would accept an assertion with UP=0 (no
      human touched the authenticator) or one made for a different RP; the
      signature is over those bytes but says nothing about their contents.
    - the ECDSA P-256 signature over `authData || SHA-256(clientDataJSON)`
      verifies against the stored public key. WebAuthn signatures are
      DER-encoded and `crypto.subtle` wants raw IEEE-P1363, so `webauthn.der`
      converts.
    - the returned `:sign-count` lets the caller apply WebAuthn L2 §7.2 step
      19 (clone detection) against its own stored baseline — a decision that
      needs persistence, so it belongs to the caller, not here.

  Everything is bounds-checked before it is read. At login this is entirely
  attacker-controlled input with no independent signature over the parse
  itself, and `aget`/`.slice` past the end silently yield `undefined`/a
  clamped range rather than throwing.

  ## Single-use challenges are the caller's job, and they are not optional

  A challenge that can be replayed is a replayable sign-in. This namespace
  compares the presented challenge to the one it was handed; making sure that
  value can only be handed over once is a storage property (a Durable Object,
  a transaction, a compare-and-delete), which is exactly why it is not
  implemented here.

  ## Malformed input is a client error, never a server error

  Every parse runs inside a guard that resolves to `{:ok false :status 400}`.
  Ported deliberately: the origin implementation had three separate
  regressions where a bad base64url length or a malformed DER signature threw
  synchronously out of a `.then` and got misclassified as an internal 500.

  CLJS-only (js/crypto.subtle, js/Uint8Array, js/TextDecoder)."

;; `cacao.edge.cbor` rather than a fifth copy of a CBOR decoder in this
;; workspace: it is the shared edge implementation (definite-length RFC 8949
;; subset, js/Uint8Array), already used by cacao.edge.verify, cloud-itonami and
;; cloud-manimani. The namespace lives in the cacao repo for historical reasons
;; -- it is not CACAO-specific, and attestationObject/COSE_Key need exactly the
;; same restricted profile.
