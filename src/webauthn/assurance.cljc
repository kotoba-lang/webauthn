  "How much a registered Passkey credential actually proves about where its
  private key lives.

  This exists because of one decision and one hazard.

  The decision (2026-07-30): payments are approved with a **Secure Enclave key
  requiring Touch ID**, so that an agent cannot approve on the human's behalf.
  The key is non-extractable and every signature needs the sensor.

  The hazard: *asking* for a platform authenticator does not *get* you one. The
  `authenticatorSelection` in a registration request is a request to the client,
  and the client is the thing we are trying to constrain. Chrome DevTools ships
  a **virtual authenticator** that reports `platform`, performs user
  verification automatically, and signs whatever it is asked to -- programmatically,
  with no human. An agent that drives a browser can turn it on. So a check that
  reads `authenticatorAttachment` off the response and concludes 'hardware' is
  not a gate; it is a comment.

  What is actually verifiable, weakest to strongest:

  | level | based on | a lying client... |
  |---|---|---|
  | `:unknown` | nothing recorded | n/a |
  | `:platform-claimed` | `authenticatorAttachment` in the response | ...simply says `platform`. UNSIGNED. |
  | `:platform-attested` | AAGUID inside signed authenticator data | ...must forge signed authData |
  | `:hardware-attested` | attestation chain to a configured root | ...must forge Apple's signature |

  Only the bottom two rows are evidence. `:platform-claimed` is recorded because
  it is worth having in the ledger, and named `claimed` so that nobody reads it
  as `verified`.

  A caveat that matters in practice: a browser may deliberately ZERO the AAGUID
  for privacy when attestation is `none`. A zeroed AAGUID therefore means 'the
  browser withheld it', NOT 'this authenticator is suspicious'. That is why
  registration asks for `direct` attestation -- to get the AAGUID at all -- and
  why an all-zero AAGUID drops to `:platform-claimed` rather than being refused.

  Everything here is PURE. It grades a stored map -- the ceremony and the
  enforcement live in the consuming application, so this rule can be tested
  without a browser, a device, or a human finger.

  ## Where this came from, and why it is shared

  Written for `cloud-itonami-app` on 2026-07-30, when payments were bound to a
  Secure Enclave key requiring Touch ID. `cloud-itonami` (the Cloudflare edge)
  had no equivalent: it recorded `backup-eligible?`/`backup-state?` on each
  credential and computed a recovery posture from them, but nothing that said
  what the key material actually proves. Two surfaces of one product disagreeing
  about how strong a passkey is, is the failure this move prevents.

  Moved here 2026-08-07 rather than into a new repo: \"what a WebAuthn
  credential proves\" is this repository's subject."

  `:min-assurance :platform-claimed` is the shipped floor, and it is chosen

  registration -- whether it discloses a real AAGUID under `direct` attestation --
  and that is measurable rather than guessable. Setting a floor here that the
  hardware cannot clear would register a passkey successfully and then refuse
  every payment, which looks like a bug and is worse than a stated limitation.
